You already know what this blog might be about. A random guy, who learned some random language, describing his random experiences as a random coder. Well, I love that word. “Coder”. It sounds amazing. ‘Programmer’ is such a geeky word. Oh, you may think I am also a geek to write such a blog. Okay now there is a difference between “being a geek” and “being passionate”.

Okay, back to the point. This page is where I want to share how I was introduced to coding, how my coding life took turns and where it is going right now. This page will prove as a guide to those who want an introduction to programming (although, I hate that word). This will also help you not make the mistakes I have made. If you have any suggestions or ideas or if you are interested in working with me on something, I will be honored to hear from you.

(A secret thought I have in my mind is that, maybe I am going to become one of the best coders of this world one day, or at least my company (not yet found :p) will be the brand name one day. At that time, this blog will help a lot of people as to where Denny began and how he came so far. It will also help me remember my journey ). -->
